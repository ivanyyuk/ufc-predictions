# ufc-predictions

This project attempts to predict the outcome of UFC fights. 

I make my predictions based on mma-Math 
(Fighter A beat Fighter B, Fighter B beat Fighter C, Therefore Fighter A will beat Fighter C)
as well as taking into account takedown %, submission  % and more. 

I have parsed the [UFC data api](http://ufc-data-api.ufc.com/api/v3/iphone) to get statistics and it is only as accurate as their API (which is not very thorough).

This is built with Node, Express and MongoDb on the backend, and React/Redux on the front-end. 

Styling done with [http://materializecss.com/](MaterializeCss)

Also used AutoComplete component from [http://www.material-ui.com/](Material-UI)
